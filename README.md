# Firebase: Unexpected Errors Due to Database Rules and Async Handling
This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Firebase Realtime Database: unexpected errors caused by misconfigured database rules and improper handling of asynchronous operations.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file showcases incorrect handling of database operations that may throw errors and fails to properly handle asynchronous promises.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version of the code.  It shows how to correctly structure asynchronous operations using `.then()` and `.catch()` and suggests improvements for proper database rule configuration for efficient and secure data handling.
