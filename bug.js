The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the database rules are incorrectly configured, preventing data access or causing unexpected behavior.  For example, if your rules are too restrictive, read or write operations might fail silently or throw a permission denied error.  Another potential issue is improperly handling asynchronous operations, such as when reading data from the database.  Not using `.then()` or `.catch()` properly to handle promises can lead to unexpected behavior or silent failures.
